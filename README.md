# Financial_Analysis
This is a dummy project on financial analysis, it involves step by step analysis of a financial dataset. 
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.
The steps involve analysing the columns of the dataset
- Checking for null values
- Checking skewness of various features
- Checking for outliers using box-plot
